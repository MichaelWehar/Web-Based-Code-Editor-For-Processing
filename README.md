# **Web-Based Code Editor For Processing**

## Web Demo
Try it yourself here: [https://michaelwehar.github.io/Web-Based-Code-Editor-For-Processing/](https://michaelwehar.github.io/Web-Based-Code-Editor-For-Processing/)

## Why Did I Create This?
My students are learning the [Processing](https://processing.org) programming language and sometimes we need a quick and convenient way to test their code examples and save their images, especially if the official IDE hasn't yet been installed or if installing new applications is not possible on their devices.

## How Does It Work?
- Uses [Processing.js v1.6.6](https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js/tree/v1.6.6) which is no longer maintained.  (MIT License)
- Uses [Open-Source Web-Based Code Editor](https://github.com/MichaelWehar/Open-Source-Embedded-Code-Editor/) which is an ongoing project (MIT License).

## **License & Notice**
